                    Hey Everyone. My name is Jaleel Bennett and I am  21 years old.
                    Would you like to guess where I am from? I'll give you a hint; it is the
                    best country in the world. If you guessed Jamaica then you are right! I 
                    am currently living in Brooklyn and I am a Computer Science major pursuing 
                    a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science. I not interested in many things but
                    the few things I care for are software engineering, anime, YouTube and Fifa.
                    If I were to have a mentor I would probably want them to be Kevin Powell. He 
                    is an experienced front-end dev who has been in the industry for decades. With
                    that being said that is all i have to say for today. Thank you for reading. Goodbye!
